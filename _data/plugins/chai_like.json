chai-like\n\nA JSON matcher for chai.\nThis is really useful when you are testing API and want to ignore some attributes like:\n updatedAt, createdAt, id.\n\n##  Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai-like)\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev chai-like\n```\n\n## Assertions\n\n### like(value)\n\nCompare two JSON and ignore some keys based on expectation.\n\n```js\nvar object = {\n  id: 1,\n  name: 'test',\n  updatedAt: 'now'\n};\nobject.should.like({\n  name: 'test'\n});\nobject.should.not.like({\n  name: 'test1'\n});\n```\n\nDeeply compare.\n\n```js\nvar object = {\n  id: 1,\n  name: 'test',\n  product: {\n    id: 1,\n    name: 'product'\n  },\n  updatedAt: 'now'\n};\nobject.should.like({\n  name: 'test',\n  product: {\n    name: 'product'\n  }\n});\nobject.should.not.like({\n  name: 'test',\n  product: {\n    name: 'product1'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nCompare array.\n\n```js\nvar array = [{\n  id: 1,\n  name: 'test',\n  product: {\n    id: 1,\n    name: 'product'\n  },\n  updatedAt: 'now'\n}];\narray.should.like([{\n  name: 'test',\n  product: {\n    name: 'product'\n  }\n}]);\narray.should.not.like([{\n  name: 'test',\n  product: {\n    name: 'product1'\n  }\n}]);\n```\n\nCompare JSON with an array sub node.\n\n```js\nvar object = {\n  id: 1,\n  name: 'test',\n  products: [{\n    id: 1,\n    name: 'product'\n  }],\n  updatedAt: 'now'\n};\nobject.should.like({\n  name: 'test',\n  products: [{\n    name: 'product'\n  }]\n});\nobject.should.not.like({\n  name: 'test',\n  products: [{\n    name: 'product1'\n  }]\n});\n```\n\n## Plugins\n\nYou can extend chai-like with plugins as below format:\n\n```js\nvar chai = require('chai');\nvar like = require('chai-like');\n\nvar numberStringPlugin = {\n  match: function(object) {\n    return !isNaN(Number(object));\n  },\n  assert: function(object, expected) {\n    return object === Number(expected);\n  }\n};\nlike.extend(numberStringPlugin);\n\nchai.use(like);\n```\n\nThen we can assert as below:\n\n```js\n  var object = {\n    number: 123\n  };\n  object.should.like({\n    number: '123'\n  });\n  object.should.not.like({\n    number: 'not a number'\n  });\n```\n\n### Plugin for testing strings with RegExp\n\nIf some strings require fuzzy matching we can do this with a plugin as follows: \n\n```js\nvar chai = require('chai');\nvar like = require('chai-like');\n\nvar regexPlugin = like.extend({\n  match: function(object, expected) {\n    return typeof object === 'string' && expected instanceof RegExp;\n  },\n  assert: function(object, expected) {\n    return expected.test(object);\n  }\n});\n\nlike.extend(regexPlugin);\n\nchai.use(like);\n```\n\nThen we can assert as below:\n\n```js\nvar object = {\n  text: 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'\n};\nobject.should.like({\n  text: /.* jumps over .*/\n});\nobject.should.not.like({\n  text: /\\d/\n});\n```","maintainers":[{"name":"zation","email":"zation1@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-01-21T14:40:13.287Z","created":"2015-03-26T08:45:13.839Z","0.0.1":"2015-03-26T08:45:13.839Z","0.0.2":"2015-03-26T08:49:53.757Z","0.0.3":"2015-03-26T09:17:35.536Z","0.0.4":"2015-03-26T14:36:24.164Z","0.0.5":"2015-03-27T02:55:29.328Z","0.0.6":"2015-03-28T09:33:37.930Z","0.1.6":"2015-06-04T03:10:20.955Z","0.1.7":"2015-06-04T04:22:09.972Z","0.1.8":"2015-11-20T02:01:23.805Z","0.1.9":"2015-12-03T09:16:49.121Z","0.1.10":"2016-08-09T01:41:25.504Z","0.2.10":"2017-01-31T15:56:25.683Z","0.2.11":"2017-06-17T01:45:45.263Z","0.2.12":"2017-06-17T01:48:42.921Z","0.2.13":"2017-06-17T01:52:57.739Z","0.2.14":"2017-06-20T16:08:12.811Z","1.0.0":"2018-01-02T10:56:36.007Z","1.0.1":"2018-01-03T02:50:07.189Z","1.1.1":"2018-01-21T14:40:13.287Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/zation/chai-like","keywords":["chai","chai-plugin","objects","json","like","test","integration","API"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/zation/chai-like.git"},"author":{"name":"Zation","email":"zation1@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/zation/chai-like/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
